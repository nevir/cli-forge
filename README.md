CLI Forge
=========

Beat your CLI tool suites into submission!

* Create CLI tools that are easily extended (`git style args` -> `git-style args`)

* A help system that is friendly to you _and_ your users.

* That warm fuzzy feeling of being able to support plugin commands written in
  any language.


Ok... How Do I?
===============

Let's start with the most basic example:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "cli-forge"

CLIForge.start
```
